# Resumeness
A simple website that builds resumes and CVs. The front end was built using React. For the backend we used node.js . We used MongoDB as a databse system.
How to run:
1- Navigate to the resumness-backend folder from your terminal.
2- run nmpm install
3- create .env file and add three environemnt variables:

connection_string 

4- run nodemon server.js. The server must be listening to port 8080

5- Navigate to the resumness folder from your terminal.
